# My Portfolio

## This is technically my second go at a portfolio - but my first go at a good one. I'm hoping to build this portfolio over time to be the main place I send people to look at my work. 

I still have a lot of work to do with the look and functionality of the page, but so far I think I have a good structure, and I have built media queries for added functionality in the meantime. 

I'm excited to build onto this portfolio page once I have more work to showcase!

Here is the link to the deployed webpade:
