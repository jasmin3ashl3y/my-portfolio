# My Portfolio

This is technically my second go at a portfolio - but my first go at a good one. I'm hoping to build this portfolio over time as I learn more about code, and I hope for it to be the main place I send people to look at my work.

I still have a lot of work to do with the look and functionality of the page, but so far I think I have a good structure, and I have built media queries for added functionality in the meantime. 

I'm excited to build onto this portfolio page once I have more work to showcase! So far I already have a few links to some of my work on there, but I need to clean it up and make it look nicer.

Here is the link to the deployed website:
